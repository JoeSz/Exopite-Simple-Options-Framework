### DESCRIPTION

WHY?
I need someting fast, easy and lightweight to generate option page and/or metabox for my plugins, themes and/or post types.

I also love to create/code to have fun and leary every day someting new.

This framework not designed to work on mobiles. It is however working except sorting (https://caniuse.com/#feat=dragndrop) and chosen dropdown (only design, the dropdown still working).
I do not think that plugin or theme will be managed on mobile devices, tons of settings create a very loooong page in mobile, which - in my opinion -
already make unuseable in mobile devices.

For my theme I used to use CodeStar Framework, so I created similarly. Unfortunately CodeStar Framework based on static class, can not initialize multiple times and this is required for plugns. <br>
(Ps. the new CodeStar (2.x) can be used multiple times, but only Options Frameworks are free.)

### FEATURES

- Easy field generator for plugin options for metabox for any post type.
- All field support callback on default value, content callback for content and notice field.
- Dependency handling, also for section tabs (only in tabbed=true).
- No ads, and never will.
- Files are loaded only when required.
- Minimum footprint.
- Multilang support for WPML, Polylang, WP Multilang and qTranslate-X.
- Availability to save post meta as simple (each setting has it's own custom field) instead of an array.

- accordion
- ACE editor

#### Lightweight

No ads, Files are loaded only when required. Minimum footprint.

#### Integration

Easy to integrate with any plugin, post type or WordPress theme.

#### Open Source

Exopite Simple Options is free and available on Github. Feel free to submit patches or add more features.

### IMPORTANT
* As 2018-09-11 we have a new hooks name to meet WordPress standards.
* After multilanguage compatibility the <b>options array did changed.</b><br>
from `unique[field-id]` to `unique[current_lang][field-id]` where:<br>
if multilang plugin installed, then the selected language, otherwise WordPress installed language.<br>
You can disable this with `'multilang' => false` option.

> ### NOTE
>
> The Framework still in development stage. <br />
> Documentation is still in-progress.
>
> The Framework based on some CodeStar Framework, MetaBox.io code and design. The fields configs desgin also based on CodeStar Framework.

#### Why did we add options to save meta as "simple"
Simple options is stored az induvidual meta key, value pair, otherwise it is stored in an array.

I implemented this option because it is possible to search in serialized (array) post meta:
- https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/16709/meta-query-with-meta-values-as-serialize-arrays
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15056407/wordpress-search-serialized-meta-data-with-custom-query
- https://www.simonbattersby.com/blog/2013/03/querying-wordpress-serialized-custom-post-data/

but there is no way to sort them with wp_query or SQL.

https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/87265/order-by-meta-value-serialized-array/87268#87268<br>

It is possible to get all required posts and store them in an array and then sort them as an array, but what if you want
multiple keys/value pair to be sorted?

UPDATE<br>
it is maybe possible:<br>
http://www.russellengland.com/2012/07/how-to-unserialize-data-using-mysql.html<br>
but it is waaay more complicated and less documented as meta query sort and search.
It should be not an excuse to use it, but it is not as reliable as it should be.

```

##### Get options:
* for "menu" use:
Eg.:
```php
$my_options = get_option( 'my-plugin-slug' );
if ( $my_options[$current_lang]['my-option-name'] ) {
    // code...
}
```
OR
```php
// Detect language automatically.
$my_options = get_exopite_sof_option( 'my-plugin-slug' );
if ( $my_options['my-option-name'] ) {
    // code...
}
```
You can check if you get the right options with:
```php
var_export( $my_options, true );
```

* for "meta" use:
```php
$my_meta_options = get_post_meta( get_the_ID(), 'my-plugin-slug', true ); // array
// -- OR as simple --
$my_meta_options = get_post_meta( get_the_ID(), 'my-option-name', true ); // as single, type mixed
```

SUPPORT/UPDATES/CONTRIBUTIONS
-----------------------------

If you use my program(s), I would **greatly appreciate it if you kindly give me some suggestions/feedback**. If you solve some issue or fix some bugs or add a new feature, please share with me or mke a pull request. (But I don't have to agree with you or necessarily follow your advice.)<br/>
**Before open an issue** please read the readme (if any :) ), use google and your brain to try to solve the issue by yourself. After all, Github is for developers.<br/>
My **updates will be irregular**, because if the current stage of the program fulfills all of my needs or I do not encounter any bugs, then I have nothing to do.<br/>
**I provide no support.** I wrote these programs for myself. For fun. For free. In my free time. It does not have to work for everyone. However, that does not mean that I do not want to help.<br/>
I've always tested my codes very hard, but it's impossible to test all possible scenarios. Most of the problem could be solved by a simple google search in a matter of minutes. I do the same thing if I download and use a plugin and I run into some errors/bugs.
